            <p class="white">In this project i have used all general tags like buttom,iframe,img,div,header,footer.I have tried to enhance the quality and appearance by using visual components like opacity and shadows in CSS. I played with font family,font weight,font size and used icons in footer section.For navigation i used a satndard navbar and gave the links a hover effect.The major special effects used by me are border-shadow, opacity,hover,flex,image in background box and opacity</p>
